Brief:

1) Design a simple web page that can host a JavaScript application.

2) All parts of the application element should be rendered using JavaScript.

3) The application will be of a rectangular shape and fill the width of the screen in a landscape fashion.

4) Render a square and make it move backwards and forwards on the horizontal access in line with the mid-point of the application.

5) Render another square and make it move up and down on the vertical access in line with the mid-point of the application.

6) Display two numeric values that represent the number of times each square has crossed the mid-point.

7) Each of the squares should run at a random speed that is selected on page load and persists for the duration of the session.

8) Colour the application as you see fit but bear in mind this will have no impact on success.
